# 📖 Introduction to Git

Git is the most popular version control system in the world, used by millions of
developers to track code changes. It acts like a time machine for your project,
letting you save snapshots of your files so you never lose your work. 💡

### Why Do We Need Git? 🤔

Imagine you are building a website. You make a few changes, and suddenly
everything breaks. Without Git, you would have to spam `Ctrl + Z` or keep a
dozen messy backup folders like `project_final_v2_actual_final`.

With Git, you can comfortably experiment with your codebase. If a new feature
breaks your application, you can roll back to a working version with a single
command. It also makes collaborating with other developers seamless, ensuring
two people don't accidentally overwrite each other's work.

### Git vs. GitHub: What's the Difference? ⚖️

A common point of confusion for beginners is mixing up Git and GitHub. They work
together, but they are completely different tools:

- **Git:** The local tool installed on your computer. It manages your history,
  takes snapshots, and handles version tracking.
- **GitHub:** A cloud-based hosting platform. It acts as a remote home for the
  Git repositories you create, allowing you to share code and collaborate with
  others online.

Think of **Git** as the camera taking the photos, and **GitHub** as Instagram
where you upload and share them. 📸
