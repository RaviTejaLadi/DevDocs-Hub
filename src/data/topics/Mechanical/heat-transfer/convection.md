# 🌬️ Convection

Convection is the transfer of heat between a surface and a moving fluid (liquid
or gas).

Unlike conduction, convection involves the actual movement of fluid particles.
As the fluid moves, it carries thermal energy from one place to another.

### ☕ Everyday Examples

- Water circulating while boiling.
- Cooling of hot tea by blowing air over it.
- Air conditioner cooling a room.
- Warm air rising from a heater.

## 🎯 How Convection Works

Convection occurs in two steps:

1. Heat is transferred from the surface to the fluid by conduction.
2. The moving fluid carries the heat away.

### Example: Boiling Water

When water at the bottom of a pot is heated:

- Water near the bottom becomes hot.
- Its density decreases.
- It rises upward.
- Cooler water moves downward.
- A circulation pattern is formed.

This continuous circulation transfers heat throughout the fluid.

## 🌊 Types of Convection

### 1️⃣ Natural Convection

Fluid motion occurs naturally due to density differences caused by temperature
changes.

Examples:

- Warm air rising from a radiator.
- Smoke rising from a fire.
- Cooling of a hot cup of coffee.

### Characteristics

✅ No external device required

✅ Lower heat transfer rate

✅ Simpler system

### 2️⃣ Forced Convection

Fluid movement is created by an external device such as:

- Fan
- Pump
- Blower
- Compressor

Examples:

- Air conditioner
- Car radiator
- Computer cooling fan
- Industrial heat exchangers

### Characteristics

✅ Higher heat transfer rate

✅ Faster cooling

✅ Better temperature control

## 📏 Newton's Law of Cooling

The rate of convective heat transfer is given by Newton's Law of Cooling.

:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Where:

- Q = Heat transfer rate (W)
- h = Convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m²·K)
- A = Surface area (m²)
- Tₛ = Surface temperature
- T∞ = Fluid temperature away from the surface

## 🔍 Meaning of Heat Transfer Coefficient (h)

The convection coefficient indicates how effectively heat is transferred between
a surface and a fluid.

Higher h means better heat transfer.

### Typical Values

| Situation              | h (W/m²·K)      |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Natural air convection | 5 - 25          |
| Forced air convection  | 25 - 250        |
| Water flow             | 100 - 10,000    |
| Boiling                | 2,500 - 100,000 |

## 🌡️ Thermal Boundary Layer

When fluid flows over a surface, the fluid layer touching the surface moves very
slowly.

A temperature gradient develops near the surface.

This region is called the thermal boundary layer.

\`\`\`

A thinner boundary layer generally results in higher heat transfer.

## ⚙️ Factors Affecting Convection

### Temperature Difference

Larger temperature difference increases heat transfer.

### Fluid Velocity

Higher velocity removes heat faster.

### Surface Area

Larger area increases heat transfer.

### Fluid Properties

Different fluids transfer heat differently.

Example:

- Water transfers heat more effectively than air.

## 🏭 Engineering Applications

### Car Radiators

Coolant transfers heat to radiator tubes, and air removes the heat.

### Air Conditioners

Heat is transferred between refrigerant and air.

### Power Plants

Steam and cooling water exchange heat continuously.

### Electronic Cooling

Fans increase heat removal from processors and electronic components.

### Refrigerators

Heat is removed from stored food and rejected to surrounding air.

## Comparison: Natural vs Forced Convection

| Feature            | Natural Convection        | Forced Convection     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Fluid Motion       | Due to density difference | Due to fan or pump    |
| Heat Transfer Rate | Lower                     | Higher                |
| Equipment Needed   | No                        | Yes                   |
| Cost               | Lower                     | Higher                |
| Applications       | Room heating              | Radiators, AC systems |
