# ♻️ Thermodynamic Cycles

A thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic processes that return a
system to its initial state.

During a cycle, the working fluid undergoes changes in pressure, temperature,
and volume while exchanging heat and work with the surroundings.

Thermodynamic cycles form the foundation of:

- Power plants
- Automobile engines
- Refrigeration systems
- Air conditioners
- Gas turbines

## 🎯 What is a Thermodynamic Cycle?

A thermodynamic cycle begins at an initial state and passes through several
processes before returning to the same state.

Since the system returns to its original condition:

```
ΔU = 0
```

Where:

- ΔU = Change in Internal Energy

According to the First Law:

```
Q = W
```

Net heat transfer equals net work done over an entire cycle.

## 🔄 Basic Cycle Representation

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> A
```

The system continuously repeats this sequence.

## ⚙️ Why Are Thermodynamic Cycles Important?

Most engineering systems operate in cycles.

Examples:

### 🚗 Automobile Engine

Fuel burns repeatedly to produce power.

### 🏭 Steam Power Plant

Steam continuously circulates through the system.

### ❄️ Refrigerator

Refrigerant repeatedly absorbs and rejects heat.

### ✈️ Gas Turbine

Air continuously undergoes compression, heating, and expansion.

## 🔥 Heat Engine Cycle

A heat engine converts thermal energy into useful work.

### Working Principle

1. Heat is absorbed from a high-temperature source.
2. Part of the heat is converted into work.
3. Remaining heat is rejected to a low-temperature sink.
4. The cycle repeats.

```

## ❄️ Refrigeration Cycle

A refrigeration cycle works in the opposite direction of a heat engine.

It uses work input to transfer heat from a low-temperature region to a
high-temperature region.

## 📊 Types of Thermodynamic Cycles

Thermodynamic cycles are broadly classified into two categories.

### Power Cycles

Power cycles produce work output.

Examples:

- Carnot Cycle
- Rankine Cycle
- Otto Cycle
- Diesel Cycle
- Brayton Cycle

    P --> O[Otto]
    P --> D[Diesel]

```

### Refrigeration Cycles

Refrigeration cycles consume work to move heat.

Examples:

- Vapor Compression Cycle
- Carnot Refrigeration Cycle
- Absorption Refrigeration Cycle

```mermaid

## 🌡️ Reversible and Irreversible Cycles

### Reversible Cycle

An ideal cycle with no losses.

Characteristics:

- No friction
- No heat loss
- Maximum possible efficiency

Example:

- Carnot Cycle

### Irreversible Cycle

Real-world cycles always contain losses.

Sources of irreversibility:

- Friction
- Heat loss
- Fluid resistance
- Turbulence

## 📈 Thermodynamic Cycle on a P-V Diagram

A cycle is often represented on a Pressure-Volume diagram.

The enclosed area represents net work done.

```mermaid

    B[State 2]
    C[State 3]
    D[State 4]

    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> A
```

### Important Observation

- Larger enclosed area → More work output
- Smaller enclosed area → Less work output

## 🔥 Carnot Cycle

The Carnot Cycle is an ideal cycle with the highest possible efficiency between
two temperatures.

- Fully reversible
- No entropy generation
- Maximum theoretical efficiency

- Efficiency benchmark for heat engines

## 🏭 Rankine Cycle

The Rankine Cycle is the basic operating cycle of steam power plants.

The Otto Cycle represents the ideal cycle of petrol engines.

- Compression
- Combustion
- Expansion
- Exhaust

## ⚡ Efficiency of a Cycle

Thermal efficiency measures how effectively heat is converted into work.

```
η = Wnet / Qin
```

Where:

- η = Thermal Efficiency
- Wnet = Net Work Output
- Qin = Heat Supplied

Higher efficiency means:

- More useful work
- Less wasted energy
