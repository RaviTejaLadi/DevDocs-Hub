# Type Aliases

## Definition

Reusable custom types.

## Syntax

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

## Usage

```ts
const user: User = {
  name: 'Ravi',
  age: 25,
};
```

## Union Alias

```ts
type ID = string | number;
```

## Interview Angle

Type aliases shine when composing union/intersection types and reusable API
shapes.

## Advanced Composition

```ts
type BaseUser = { id: string; name: string };
type AdminUser = BaseUser & { permissions: string[] };
```

## When to Use

- Use `type` for unions, intersections, mapped and conditional types.
- Prefer clear, domain names like `UserId`, `ApiResponse<T>`, `FormState`.

## Common Interview Question

"Difference between `type` and `interface` and when would you choose each?"
