# Metadata And Seo Basics

### 1. The Title Tag (`<title>`)

This is arguably the most important SEO tag in your entire document.

- **Where it appears:**

1. The text in the **browser tab**.
2. The **clickable blue headline** in search engine results (SERPs).

- **Best Practices:**
- Keep it unique for every page.
- Keep it under ~60 characters (otherwise Google cuts it off with "...").
- **Format:** `Primary Keyword - Secondary Keyword | Brand Name`

### 2. Standard Meta Tags

Meta tags provide metadata (information about data).

#### A. Character Set (`charset`)

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

- **Function:** Tells the browser how to translate the file's raw machine bytes
  into readable characters.
- **Why UTF-8?** It is the universal standard that supports virtually all human
  languages and symbols (including Emojis 🚀). Without this, users might see
  broken characters like ``or`â€™`.

#### B. The Viewport Tag (Mobile Responsiveness)

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

- **Context:** Without this tag, mobile phones assume they are displaying a
  desktop site and will "zoom out" to fit the whole page, making text tiny and
  unreadable.
- **Function:** Tells the browser: "Make the width of the website match the
  width of the device (`width=device-width`) and set the zoom level to 100%
  (`initial-scale=1.0`)." **This is mandatory for responsive design.**

#### C. Meta Description

```html
<meta
  name="description"
  content="A brief summary of the page content used for search results."
/>
```

- **Function:** This text appears as the grey description snippet under the blue
  link in Google.
- **SEO Impact:** It does **not** directly affect ranking, but a good
  description increases **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**. If users click your link
  more often, your ranking improves.

#### D. Meta Keywords (Obsolete)

- **History:** Used to tell search engines what the page was about.
- **Reality:** Google **stopped using this years ago** because people abused it
  (keyword stuffing). You do not need to include this tag anymore.

### 3. Favicon

The favicon is the small icon displayed next to the page title in the browser
tab.

- **Old Standard:** `.ico` files.
- **Modern Standard:** PNG or SVG files are widely supported.
- **Syntax:**

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/images/favicon.png" type="image/png" />
```

### 4. Open Graph (Social Previews)

Have you noticed that when you paste a link into WhatsApp, Twitter, or LinkedIn,
it automatically generates a "Card" with an image, title, and description? That
is **Open Graph (OG)** protocol.

Without these tags, social platforms will guess what to show (often picking a
random navigational icon or cutting off text).

- **Key Tags:**
- `og:title`: The title of the card (usually matches your `<title>`).
- `og:description`: A concise summary (usually matches your meta description).
- `og:image`: The absolute URL of the image you want displayed. **This is
  crucial for engagement.**
- `og:url`: The canonical URL of the page.

**Example Code:**

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Learn HTML Basics" />
<meta
  property="og:description"
  content="A comprehensive guide to web development."
/>
<meta property="og:image" content="https://mysite.com/thumbnail.jpg" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
```
