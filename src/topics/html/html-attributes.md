# HTML Attributes

### 1. Identity & Classification (`id`, `class`)

These are the primary hooks used by CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for
functionality).

- **`id` (Identity):**
- **Rule:** Must be **unique** within the entire page. No two elements can have
  the same `id`.
- **Usage:** Used for specific, singular elements (e.g., `#main-header`,
  `#submit-btn`).
- **Selector:** In CSS/JS, it is targeted with a hash (`#`).
- **Navigation:** Used as an anchor for internal page links (e.g.,
  `<a href="#section1">`).

- **`class`:**
- **Rule:** Can be reused on as many elements as you want.
- **Usage:** Used for grouping elements that share the same style or behavior
  (e.g., `.card`, `.btn-primary`, `.text-red`).
- **Selector:** In CSS/JS, it is targeted with a dot (`.`).
- **Multiple Classes:** You can assign multiple classes by separating them with
  a space: `class="btn btn-large btn-red"`.

| Feature             | `id`                   | `class`                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Uniqueness**      | Unique per page        | Reusable                   |
| **CSS Specificity** | High (Overrides class) | Medium                     |
| **JavaScript**      | `getElementById()`     | `getElementsByClassName()` |

### 2. Styling (`style`)

This attribute applies **inline CSS** directly to an element.

- **Syntax:** `<div style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Error</div>`
- **Best Practice:** **Avoid using this.** It makes code hard to maintain and
  overrides external stylesheets. Use external CSS classes instead.
- **Exception:** Useful for dynamic values set by JavaScript (e.g., a progress
  bar width changing in real-time).

### 3. Tooltips (`title`)

- **Function:** Provides advisory information about the element.
- **Visual:** When a user hovers their mouse over the element, a small
  browser-native tooltip appears with the text.
- **Accessibility Note:** It is often inaccessible to mobile users (no mouse
  hover) and some screen readers. Do not rely on it for critical instructions.

### 4. Visibility (`hidden`)

- **Function:** Boolean attribute. If present, the browser hides the element
  completely.
- **Behavior:** It is functionally similar to CSS `display: none`. The element
  is not rendered and takes up no space.
- **Usage:** `<div hidden>You cannot see me</div>`

### 5. Keyboard Navigation (`tabindex`)

This controls if and how an element can be focused using the keyboard
(specifically the `Tab` key).

- **`tabindex="0"`:** Inserts the element into the natural tab order (based on
  its position in the HTML). Makes non-interactive elements (like a `div`)
  focusable.
- **`tabindex="-1"`:** Removes the element from the natural tab order (user
  cannot Tab to it), but it can still be focused programmatically via JavaScript
  (`el.focus()`). Used for modals or popups.
- **`tabindex="1"` (and higher):** Forces a specific priority order. **Avoid
  this.** It disrupts the natural flow for screen reader users and creates a
  confusing experience ("Tab jacking").

### 6. Editability (`contenteditable`)

- **Function:** Turns any HTML element into a rich-text editor area.
- **Usage:** `<div contenteditable="true">Edit this text!</div>`
- **Application:** This is the underlying technology behind web-based editors
  like Gmail, Notion, or Trello cards.

### 7. Custom Data (`data-*`)

This is the standard way to store extra information within the DOM that is
purely for your script to use, without affecting the UI.

- **Syntax:** You can invent any attribute name as long as it starts with
  `data-`.
- **Example:**

```html
<article
  id="post-123"
  data-author="John Doe"
  data-category="News"
  data-publish-date="2023-10-01"
>
  ...
</article>
```

- **Accessing in JavaScript:**
- **Old Way:** `element.getAttribute('data-author')`
- **Modern Way:** `element.dataset.author` (Note: camelCase is automatically
  handled).
