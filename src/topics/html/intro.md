**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and
structure content on the web. Every website you see in a browser is built on
HTML. It defines **what content exists** on a page—such as headings, paragraphs,
images, links, forms, and tables—and **how that content is organized**.

HTML is a **markup language**, not a programming language. That means it doesn’t
handle logic, calculations, or interactions. Instead, it uses **tags** to label
content so browsers know how to display it. For example, a heading is marked
with `<h1>`, a paragraph with `<p>`, and a link with `<a>`.

HTML works alongside other core web technologies:

- **CSS** controls the look and layout
- **JavaScript** adds behavior and interactivity

Modern HTML also focuses on **semantic structure**, using meaningful tags like
`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`. This improves accessibility,
search engine optimization, and overall code clarity.

In short, HTML is the **foundation of the web**. Without it, there is no
structure for styling or interactivity to exist on.
