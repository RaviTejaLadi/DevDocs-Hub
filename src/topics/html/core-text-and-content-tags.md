# Core Text & Content Tags

### 1. Headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`)

Headings define the structure and hierarchy of your content. They are
block-level elements.

- **Hierarchy:** `<h1>` is the most important, decreasing in importance down to
  `<h6>`.
- **Usage Rules:**
- **`<h1>`:** Use only once per page. It represents the main topic or title of
  the entire page.
- **`<h2>`–`<h6>`:** Use these to divide content into logical sections. Do not
  skip levels (e.g., don't jump from `<h1>` to `<h3>`).

- **SEO & Accessibility:** Search engines use headings to index the structure of
  your content. Screen readers allow users to jump from heading to heading to
  navigate the page quickly.
- **Visuals:** Browsers give them default sizes (H1 being the largest), but you
  should control sizing with CSS, not by choosing a "smaller" heading tag.

### 2. Paragraphs (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag is the standard element for blocks of text.

- **Behavior:** It is a block-level element. Browsers automatically add a margin
  (white space) before and after a paragraph to separate it from surrounding
  content.
- **Constraint:** You cannot nest a block element (like a `<div>` or another
  `<p>`) inside a paragraph. If you try, the browser will automatically close
  the paragraph tag for you, often breaking your layout.

### 3. Structural Breaks (`<br>`, `<hr>`)

These are **void elements** (they have no closing tag).

- **Line Break (`<br>`):** Forces a line break _within_ the current block of
  text without starting a new paragraph.
- _Use case:_ Poems or mailing addresses where lines must break at specific
  points.
- _Anti-pattern:_ Do not use multiple `<br>` tags to create vertical space
  between sections; use CSS margins/padding instead.

- **Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`):** Represents a **thematic break** between
  paragraph-level elements.
- _Visual:_ Renders as a horizontal line across the page.
- _Meaning:_ Indicates a shift in topic within a section (e.g., a scene change
  in a story).

### 4. Text Formatting

HTML distinguishes between **semantic** tags (meaning) and **presentational**
tags (style).

#### Semantic Importance (Recommended)

- **`<strong>`:** Indicates **strong importance** or seriousness.
- _Visual:_ Bold.
- _Audio:_ Screen readers may announce this with increased tone or volume.

- **`<em>`:** Indicates **emphasis** or stress on a word.
- _Visual:_ Italic.
- _Audio:_ Screen readers change voice inflection.

#### Stylistic / Utility Tags

- **`<b>`:** Stylistically bold (brings attention without extra importance).
  Used for keywords or product names.
- **`<i>`:** Stylistically italic (alternative voice or mood). Used for
  technical terms, thoughts, or foreign words.
- **`<u>`:** Underline. _Warning:_ often confused with links; use sparingly.
- **`<mark>`:** Represents text marked or highlighted for reference or notation
  (visual is usually a yellow background).
- **`<small>`:** Represents "side comments" like copyright text, disclaimers, or
  legal fine print (renders smaller than base font).

### 5. Superscript & Subscript (`<sup>`, `<sub>`)

These tags shift text vertically and shrink the font size, typically used for
scientific or mathematical notation.

- **`<sup>` (Superscript):** Moves text up.
- _Example:_ `E = mc<sup>2</sup>` → E = mc²
- _Example:_ `4<sup>th</sup>` → 4ᵗʰ

- **`<sub>` (Subscript):** Moves text down.
- _Example:_ `H<sub>2</sub>O` → H₂O

### 6. Preformatted Text (`<pre>`, `<code>`)

Standard HTML ignores extra whitespace (multiple spaces or newlines in code are
compressed into a single space). These tags override that behavior.

- **`<code>`:** Defines a snippet of computer code.
- _Behavior:_ Uses a **monospace font**. It is an inline element.
- _Example:_ `Select the <code>body</code> tag.`

- **`<pre>`:** Defines preformatted text.
- _Behavior:_ Preserves **both spaces and line breaks** exactly as written in
  the editor. It uses a monospace font and is a block-level element.

- **The Combo:** To display a block of code (like the examples in this chat),
  you nest them:

```html
<pre>
  <code>
    const x = 10;
    console.log(x);
  </code>
</pre>
```
