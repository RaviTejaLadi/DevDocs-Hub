# Images And Media

### 1. The Image Tag (`<img>`)

The `<img>` element embeds an image into the document.

- **Syntax:** It is a **void element** (self-closing), meaning it does not have
  a closing tag.
- **Basic Example:** `<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A fluffy white cat">`

### 2. Essential Attributes: `src`, `alt`, `title`

Three attributes control the core functionality of an image.

- **`src` (Source):** The path to the image file (URL or local file path). Like
  links, if this path is wrong, the image won't load.
- **`alt` (Alternative Text):** **Crucial.** This text describes the image.
- **Accessibility:** Screen readers read this aloud to visually impaired users.
- **Fallback:** It is displayed on the screen if the image fails to load.
- **SEO:** Search engines use it to understand what the image is.
- _Rule:_ If an image is purely decorative (like a background shape), use an
  empty attribute `alt=""` so screen readers skip it.

- **`title`:** Optional text that appears as a **tooltip** when the user hovers
  the mouse over the image. It is _not_ a replacement for `alt` text.

### 3. Responsive Images (`srcset`, `sizes`)

In modern web development, you don't want to send a massive 4K image to a small
mobile phone screen (it wastes data and slows loading). The `srcset` and `sizes`
attributes solve this.

- **`srcset`:** Allows you to provide a list of image files and their intrinsic
  widths (e.g., `500w`, `1000w`).
- **`sizes`:** Tells the browser how wide the image will be displayed on the
  screen (e.g., "100% of the viewport" or "500px").
- **How it works:** The browser calculates the best image to download based on
  the user's screen resolution and current bandwidth.

```html
<img
  src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw"
  alt="Responsive example"
/>
```

_(Translation: "Here are 3 versions of the image. If the screen is smaller than
600px, the image fills the width; otherwise, it takes up half the width.
Browser, you pick the best file.")_

### 4. Audio (`<audio>`)

The `<audio>` element is used to play sound files.

- **`controls` Attribute:** Adds the browser's default Play/Pause/Volume
  interface. Without this, the audio is invisible and silent (unless you use
  JavaScript).
- **Structure:** You can use a single `src` or nested `<source>` tags for better
  compatibility.

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="song.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

_(The text inside is the fallback for very old browsers.)_

### 5. Video (`<video>`)

The `<video>` element works similarly to audio but includes dimensions.

- **Key Attributes:**
- **`controls`:** Shows play/pause buttons.
- **`width` / `height`:** defining dimensions prevents the page layout from
  "jumping" when the video loads.
- **`poster`:** An image shown while the video is downloading or before the user
  hits play (like a YouTube thumbnail).
- **`autoplay`:** Automatically plays the video (usually requires `muted` to
  work in modern browsers).
- **`muted`:** Starts the video without sound.
- **`loop`:** Replays the video automatically when finished.

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls poster="thumbnail.jpg">
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

### 6. Media Formats & Browser Support

Not all browsers support all file formats. You must choose formats carefully or
provide fallbacks.

| Media Type                  | Best Format     | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Images (Photos)**         | **JPEG / WebP** | JPEG is standard. WebP is newer, smaller, and higher quality.                |
| **Images (Icons/Graphics)** | **SVG**         | Vector format. It scales infinitely without losing quality. Ideal for logos. |
| **Images (Transparency)**   | **PNG / WebP**  | Use when you need a transparent background.                                  |
| **Video**                   | **MP4 (H.264)** | The safest bet. Supported by virtually 100% of browsers.                     |
| **Audio**                   | **MP3**         | universally supported.                                                       |
