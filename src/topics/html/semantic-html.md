# Semantic HTML

**Why is this critical for jobs?** In professional interviews, using
`<div id="header">` instead of `<header>` is often considered a red flag. It
shows a lack of knowledge about modern standards, accessibility, and SEO.

### 1. The "Big Three" Layout Structure

These tags define the macro-structure of your page.

- **`<header>`:** The introductory container for a page or a specific section.
- _Usage:_ Typically contains the logo, site title, and main navigation.
- _Note:_ Do not confuse this with `<head>` (which holds metadata). A page can
  have multiple `<header>` elements (one for the page, one for an article).

- **`<main>`:** Contains the **dominant** content of the `<body>`.
- _Rule:_ There should be **only one** `<main>` tag per page. It must not
  contain repeated content like sidebars or site-wide navigation.

- **`<footer>`:** The footer for a page or section.
- _Usage:_ Contains copyright information, contact details, sitemap links, or
  "back to top" links.

### 2. Grouping Content (`nav`, `section`, `article`, `aside`)

These tags replace generic `<div>` tags to organize content logically.

- **`<nav>` (Navigation):** Wraps a section of major navigation links.
- _Usage:_ Main site menu, table of contents, or pagination.
- _Nuance:_ Not every group of links needs `<nav>`; usually, the footer links
  are just a list, while the top bar is a `<nav>`.

- **`<section>`:** A thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
- _Analogy:_ Think of chapters in a book.
- _Usage:_ "About Us," "Services," "Contact," or "Testimonials."

- **`<article>`:** A self-contained, independent piece of content that makes
  sense on its own.
- _Test:_ If you took this chunk of code and pasted it onto another website (via
  RSS), would it still make sense?
- _Usage:_ Blog posts, news cards, forum comments, or product widgets.

- **`<aside>`:** Content that is tangentially related to the main content around
  it.
- _Usage:_ Sidebars, "Related Posts" boxes, ad blocks, or pull quotes.

### 3. Media Wrappers (`figure`, `figcaption`)

Before HTML5, we used `<div>` to wrap an image and a `<p>` for the caption. Now,
we have a semantic connection.

- **`<figure>`:** Wraps the media (image, diagram, code snippet, etc.).
- **`<figcaption>`:** Provides a caption or description for the parent
  `<figure>`.
- **The Benefit:** The browser and screen reader know that the text in
  `<figcaption>` belongs strictly to that specific image.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="chart.jpg" alt="Sales growth chart" />
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Sales increased by 20% in Q4.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### 4. Why Semantics Matter (The "Why" in Interviews)

If you are asked "Why use Semantic HTML?" answer with these two pillars:

**A. Accessibility (A11y)**

- **Landmarks:** Screen readers (used by blind users) use these tags as
  "landmarks." A user can press a hotkey to jump straight to the `<nav>` or
  `<main>` content, skipping repetitive headers and ads.
- **Clarity:** Without semantics, a screen reader just sees a "soup of divs,"
  forcing the user to listen to everything to find what they need.

**B. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**

- **Context:** Google bots read code, not pixels. When they see `<article>`,
  they know "This is the main story." When they see `<aside>`, they know "This
  is less important."
- **Ranking:** Proper structure helps search engines index your content more
  accurately, potentially improving your search ranking.
